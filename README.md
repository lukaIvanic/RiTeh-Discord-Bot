# RiTeh-Discord-Bot

A discord bot originally made for RiTeh students on discord

You can invite it here: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=764161843823902761&scope=bot&permissions=2146958847

The best feature by far is the meme fetcher. 

?meme responds with a random meme from reddit. 
The next meme is just one convenient click away!
The bot automatically generates a reaction so you're always ready for the next meme!


It can't play music as of late because of an issue with a third party library (ytdl).
Ytdl is used for getting search results from youtube.
No urls mean no http stream which means no music;
But either way the music function wasn't viable because it depended on my local internet.

The bot is online when I have the server up on my local computer.
